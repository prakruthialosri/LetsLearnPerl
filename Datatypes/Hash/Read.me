A hash is an unordered collection of key–value pairs.
Think of it like a dictionary:

Each key is unique.
Each value is accessed using its key.

In hashes we access by key → $hash{key}



Why do we even need a hash reference?
A reference is like an address / pointer to a data structure (hash/array/etc.).
Instead of copying the whole hash, you pass around a reference to it.
You’ll see references when:

passing a hash to a subroutine (very common)
building nested structures (hash inside hash, hash of arrays, etc.)
returning complex data from functions
